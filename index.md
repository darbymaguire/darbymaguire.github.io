## Who am I?

I ask myself the same question all too often. Currently, I am the Junior Data Engineer at WELL Health Inc. WELL is a start up company aiming to make patient-doctor communication as easy as texting a friend. As a data engineer, my responsibilities include creating, updating, improving, and maintaining all data pipelines in our company. As a part of a larger Agile scrum team, I also am the point of contact for Salesforce and Amazon Web Services (including RDS, EC2, and S3) tools.

I graduated from the United States Naval Academy in May 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence. While my work now is focused on data, my education took me through all aspects of full-stack development: everything from computer architecture (MIPS, C, C#) to web development (HTML, Javascript, CSS). Personal intrigue led me to tinker in Natural Language Processing, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.

While I am no longer in the military, my four years balancing being a full time student while being active-duty military taught me many invaluable lessons. I held multiple leadership positions, and was constantly learning that I am capable of doing so much more than I could ever imagine. Time management, attention to detail, teamwork, and dedication were four of the many tools in my toolbox that helped me constantly exceed goals and limits I had set for myself.

Keep scrolling to take an inside look at some highlights from my academic and professional career, and get to know me more!

#### Professional -- Ownership of Salesforce Data Pipelines (ongoing from Spring 2021)

Data is the backbone of the functionality and success of WELL Health, and much of that data goes through our Salesforce servers and cloud services. I personally took on ownership of this aspect of our company and notable projects include an automation of our previously hand-calculated customer billing process, full documentation of the multiple pipelines, and a re-vamp of one of our core data pipelines that had become defunct due to the rate at which our company was growing. Being the "point person" for Salesforce has helped me connect with people all over the company, and challenges me in my abilities to communicate both technically and non-technically when our Backend programming team or our Sales team comes to me with questions. 

#### Academic -- Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Posts (Fall 2020)

Armed with 790 MB of old tweets, I built two types of classifiers for positive, negative, and objective sentiment. Using millions of tweets amassed from users all over the world produced the unexpected challenge of cleaning the data of slang, poor grammar, non-ascii characters, and sarcasm before being able to produce an accurate classification. The first classifier used a sentiment lexicon, and the second used a logistic regression classifier. In the end, both classifiers approached an astonishing 60% accuracy, which leaves much room for improvement (but overall, not terrible for a basic language model!). 

#### Academic -- Predicted Success of Reddit Posts (Fall 2020)

After experimenting with Reddit's PRAW API, myself and two other teammates created a language model to determine how successful a Reddit post might become. PRAW became a jumping-off point for us, and we ended up accumulating over 1.65 billion comments in JSON format using pushshift.io that we would use to train and test our language model. We created a lightweight Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict various classifications of success levels. Using an 80/20 train/test split, our AI achieved an impressive 87% accuracy. 

#### Academic -- Word Arthmetic, Twitter "Search Engine" (Spring 2021)

What do you think "cat - mean + nice" equals? While a cat person might disagree, my Word2Vec program calculated it to equal "dog"! I transformed a simple numerical calulator into a more complex word calculator using 66MB of pre-trained embeddings and creating word vectors. My calculator really got down to the true meaning of certain words, as seen in the produced equation "job - fun + office = federal".

Also using a Word2Vec model, I brought back my massive Twitter dataset to create a sort of "search engine" that would take a sentence or phrase as input and return tweets most similar to it using word embeddings and a cosine comparison function.

## Enough with all the technicalities, who am I away from the screen?

When I'm not working on my latest garage project or learning a new programming language, I'm usually outdoors doing something on the border between epic and idiotic with my best friend Summit, my one-year old golden retreiver pup. My risk-taking and daring personality traits are not exclusive to my programming life, after all. 

My home office has slowly become my 3D printing studio, as I've spent a large majority of my free time experimenting with materials, code, robotics, and electronics to create some amazing projects. I even have my own Etsy shop where I can share my creations with others!

I love running, and by far my best experiences have been doing a 40-mile ultramarathon with zero training whatsoever, along with running the Marine Corps Marathon in 2019 for a non-profit called Back on My Feet that combats homelessness throughout the United States.

When I'm not running, you can also find me on the slopes or in the surf, living in sunny California gives me the incredible opportunity to even do both in one day. I'm also a big reader (thanks to my kindle!) and love any and all Margaret Atwood. I have a huge record collection and love nothing more than the smell of vinyl and coffee in the morning.
